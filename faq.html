              Please bring your laptops, chargers, personal snacks, and

              that you would bring to an overnight style hackathon. Just bring
              what you need to work on a sprig game(just a laptop), or any other
              kind of game you plan on making.

              We are going to be a free event. There have been suggestions to
              charge an entrance fee for how much we need funding to make this
              happen. We won't. All the high school events that Sahib and Kyle
              have been to have been free events. The mission is to provide an
              unforgettable experience to students. We want students of all
              different backgrounds to get the opportunities we have been
              afforded by traveling to different hackathons. We don't want to
              make cost a consideration on that principle.
